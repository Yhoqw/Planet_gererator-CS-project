This was my project submission for my CS-101 course 

The "Science Fiction Planet Generator" project is an interactive console-based application designed to engage users in exploring fictitious planets and their unique attributes. The program generates dynamic details about planets, their atmospheres, histories, and the alien races inhabiting them. Players also engage in mini-games to overcome challenges posed by alien inhabitants. This project demonstrates the use of random generation, seeding, Arrays, file I/O, and game logic in C++.
