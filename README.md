This is a remake of my original CS 101 project submission now done with Object Oriented Programming 

The "Science Fiction Planet Generator" project is an interactive console-based application designed to engage users in exploring fictitious planets and their unique attributes. The program generates dynamic details about planets, their atmospheres, histories, and the alien races inhabiting them. Players also engage in mini-games to overcome challenges posed by alien inhabitants. This project demonstrates the use of random generation, seeding, Arrays, file I/O, and game logic in C++.
